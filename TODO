- Switched back from Jetty to Tomcat. Using the 'addContextWarDependencies'
  property, with the intent that context wars are deployed.
- However, there is a problem with deploying the WARs. The following exception
  appears:
  org.codehaus.plexus.archiver.manager.NoSuchArchiverException: No such archiver: 'zip'.
- When extracting the WARs manually in the target/tomcat/webapps directory,
  everything works fine.
- Next step: Find out the reason for the 'no such archiver'. Googling for this
  error message gave very little results (at least not when the archiver type
  was 'zip'.)

- Problem that 'mvn install' from master build causes failure in
  struts frontend integration test, because it can't load a class.
- To reproduce, run
    mvn -pl ../beowulf-webservice-app,../beowulf-frontend-struts install
  from the master build directory.
  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that tomcat and jetty both run in the same
  JVM. Perhaps using jetty for everything would help.
