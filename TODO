- Problem that 'mvn install' from master build causes failure in
  struts frontend integration test, because it can't load a class.
- To reproduce, run
    mvn -pl ../beowulf-webservice-app,../beowulf-frontend-struts install
  from the master build directory.
  Perhaps it has to do with the fact that tomcat and jetty both run in the same
  JVM. Perhaps using jetty for everything would help.
