This directory contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a multi-module
maven project. 


The subdirectories are as follows:

beowulf-masterbuild            Parent POM, to build all subprojects.
beowulf-business-svc           Web service interface, used by both consumer and
                               provider implementations.
beowulf-business-svc-impl      Web service implementation
beowulf-webservice-app         A web application that exposes the webservice
                               using CXF.

Note that the service (interface) and implementation projects have nothing
webservice specific about them, other than one annotation @WebService in the
service interface. Thus, this annotation is the only thing needed to make the
POJO interface/implementation pair accessible via web service.

The whole webapp/serlet stuff (but no handwritten java code!) is in the
beowulf-webservice-app project.
